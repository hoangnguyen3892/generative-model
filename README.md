# Generative models
This is a collection of generative models

1. Variational Auto Encoder (VAE)

This is an implementation of **Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes** using Pytorch.

The code is adopted from [apaszke](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/master/vae/main.py), which is changed some part to implement in Jupyter notebook.

2. Conditional VAE

This is an extension of VAE using an extra input label y to generate new instances.

The code is adopted from [wiseodd](https://github.com/wiseodd/generative-models/tree/master/VAE/conditional_vae).
